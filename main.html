        <h1>Captain America</h1>
        <p>
          As Captain America, Steve Rogers carries a nearly indestructible
          shield fashioned from the rare Wakandan metal known as vibranium.
          Designed and crafted by genius inventor Howard Stark during World War
          II, the shield is a perfectly balanced instrument capable of
          withstanding intense stress and damage, yet also able to be thrown as
          an offensive weapon that rebounds back to its owner. Rogers maintains
          the shield as an almost constant companion after it was recovered from
          the wreckage of the Red Skull’s airplane, as it has become a symbol of
          strength to all those who recognize Captain America as the country’s
          defender. Steve Rogers’ first real enemy took the form of Johann
          Schmidt, a German scientist and wartime leader of the Nazi science
          division, Hydra. Schmidt became known as the Red Skull after a failed
          attempt to augment himself using Dr. Erskine’s super-soldier serum
          devolved his features into a crimson, skull-like countenance. His
          obsession with power led him to gain possession of the Tesseract, an
          otherworldly power source of unparalleled energy, and split off of
          Hydra from Hitler’s forces. The Red Skull met his match, though, in
          Captain America. The hero dogged the villain throughout the war until
          Schmidt’s apparent demise in his own aircraft high above the North
          Atlantic. Steve Rogers’ forthright attitude and positive disposition
          has attracted a select group of people into his inner circle of
          friends. His longest companion is James Buchanan “Bucky” Barnes, who
          Rogers met in his Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood in New York and formed a
          close friendship with. Despite Barnes’ enlistment in the Army and
          Rogers’ career as Captain America during the war, the two found each
          other and united to form a solid battlefront against the Axis. When
          Barnes seemingly fell to his death, Steve Rogers felt as if a brother
          had been taken from him.
